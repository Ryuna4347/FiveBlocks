# Five Blocks

Thanks for checking out our project!

This is a fully functional, first person multiplayer shooter game made in
Unity and with full source and assets. It is in active development by a small
team from Unity Technologies. Our goals are to test and showcase new
features in Unity and to be of use for teams who can bootstrap on top of
this, extract useful bits and tools or simply learn from and get inspired by
what is in the project.

Visit our [landing page](https://unity.com/fps-sample) for more high
level information about the project. Or reach out [in the forum](https://forum.unity.com/forums/fps-sample-game.184).

The project is using a number of new technologies: We use the new [HD Render
Pipeline](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ScriptableRenderPipeline), meaning 
all content has been authored for HDRP. We are also using the new
[network transport layer](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/multiplayer) as well as the [Entity-Component System](https://unity3d.com/unity/features/job-system-ECS). 
In the case of ECS, we have primarily adopted the "ECS-pattern" and use it in
hybrid mode with a lot of regular components. As more and more features of
Unity become available in ECS-aware versions, we will migrate to them.
